**Abstract:**
                 If a dragon were to attack in Pittsburgh, the three main things to consider are access to water, population size, and wealth distribution. 
                 Water is  useful for putting out dragon fire-breath, and areas with more people as well as more money are a high-priority target for a dragon 
                 because they will want to eat the people and places with more money usually have more possessions, and dragons love to hoard material goods. 
                 Based solely on these three metrics, it was found that the best neighborhood to be in under these circumstances is Chateau. 
                 But this neighborhood is mostly uninhabited and full of warehouses, so our groupâ€™s personal choice based on the metrics is Glen Hazel.
